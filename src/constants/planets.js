      NASA was established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), to give the U.S. space development effort a distinctly civilian orientation, 
      emphasizing peaceful applications in space science.Since its establishment,
       most American space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. NASA supports 
      the International Space Station and oversees the development of the Orion spacecraft, the Space Launch System, Commercial Crew vehicles, and the planned Lunar Gateway space station. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program, which provides 
      oversight of launch operations and countdown management for uncrewesd NASA launches.`,

    details: `The State Space Corporation "Roscosmos"[2] (Russian: Государственная корпорация по космической деятельности «Роскосмос»), 
        commonly known simply as Roscosmos (Russian: Роскосмос), is a state corporation of the Russian Federation responsible for space flights, 
        cosmonautics programs, and aerospace research.[3]

        Originating from the Soviet space program founded in the 1950s, Roscosmos emerged following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
         It initially began as the Russian Space Agency, which was established on 25 February 1992[4][Note 1] and restructured in 1999 and 2004,
          as the Russian Aviation and Space Agency[Note 2] and the Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos), respectively.[Note 3][4] In 2015, the Federal
           Space Agency (Roscosmos) was merged with the United Rocket and Space Corporation, a government corporation, to re-nationalize the Russian 
           space industry, leading to Roscosmos in its current form.[5][6][7]
        
        Roscosmos is headquartered in Moscow, with its main Mission Control Center in the nearby city of Korolyov, and the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut 
        Training Center located in Star City in Moscow Oblast. Its launch facilities include Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, the world's first
         and largest spaceport, and Vostochny Cosmodrome, which is being built in the Russian Far East in Amur Oblast. Its director since July 2022 is Yury Borisov.[8]`,

      and operation of unmanned exploration missions to other planets and the Moon; Earth observation, science and telecommunication; designing launch 
      vehicles; and maintaining a major spaceport, the Guiana Space Centre at Kourou (French Guiana), France. The main European launch vehicle Ariane 5 is
       operated through Arianespace with ESA sharing in the costs of launching and further developing this launch vehicle. The agency is also working with NASA
        to manufacture the Orion spacecraft service module that will fly on the Space Launch System`,

       space launch provider, and a satellite communications corporation headquartered in Hawthorne, California. It was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, with the goal of reducing space 
      transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars. It manufactures the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, several rocket engines, Cargo Dragon, 
      crew spacecraft, and Starlink communications satellites.

      SpaceX is developing a satellite internet constellation named Starlink to provide commercial internet service.
       In January 2020, the Starlink constellation became the largest satellite constellation ever launched, and as of September
        2022 comprises over 3,000 small satellites in orbit.[7] The company is also developing Starship, a privately funded, fully reusable, 
        super heavy-lift launch system for interplanetary and orbital spaceflight. It is intended to become SpaceX's primary orbital vehicle once operational, 
        supplanting the existing Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Dragon fleet. It will have the highest payload capacity of any orbital rocket ever built on its debut, 
        scheduled for 2022 pending launch license.[8]`,

         headquartered in Kent, Washington.[3][4] Founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos, the founder and executive chairman of Amazon, the company 
         is led by CEO Bob Smith and aims to make access to space cheaper and more reliable through reusable launch vehicles.[5][6] Rob Meyerson
          led Blue Origin from 2003 to 2017 and served as its first president.[7] Blue Origin is employing an incremental approach from suborbital
           to orbital flight,[citation needed] with each developmental step building on its prior work.[8] The company's name refers to the blue planet,
            Earth, as the point of origin.[9]

        Blue Origin develops orbital technology, rocket-powered vertical takeoff and vertical landing (VTVL) vehicles for access to suborbital and orbital
         space.[10] Initially focused on suborbital spaceflight, the company has designed, built and flown multiple testbeds of its New Shepard vehicle at 
         its facilities in Culberson County, Texas. Developmental test flights of the New Shepard,[11] named after the first American in space Alan Shepard,
          began in April 2015, and flight testing is ongoing.[12][13] Blue Origin rescheduled the original 2018 date for first passengers several times, and 
          eventually successfully flew its first crewed mission on July 20, 2021.[14] It has not yet begun commercial passenger flights, nor announced a firm 
          date for when they would begin. On nearly every one of the test flights since 2015, the uncrewed vehicle has reached a test altitude of more than 100 
          kilometers (330,000 ft) and achieved a top speed of more than Mach 3, reaching space above the Kármán line, with both the space capsule and its rocket 
          booster successfully soft landing.`,
